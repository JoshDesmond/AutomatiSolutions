# Project Context:

AutomatiSolutions.com is intended to be a simple landing page for a small botique
technical consulting initiative.

### Tech Stack:
 - Vite
 - React
 - Tailwind
 - npm

The website will be deployed using nginx on a lightweight virtual machine; More
tooling will likely be required to faciliate the build and bundling process.
Preferred constraints for such tooling include factors such as:
 - Lightweight
 - Proven longevity (See: Lindy Effect).
 - Well-suited for mutual integration

## Website Content
### AutomatiSolutions Offers
The website should prominently describe a series of product offerings. These
offerings include:

 - Web and mobile app development
 - Data ... (Organization, Processing, Visualization, Automation)
 - Process Automation
 - Cyber Security Consulting

### About Me
The website should briefly introduce me and my technical background
